## Get Started
### `npm install`
Install modules mentioned in package.json
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.  

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.  
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**  

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
